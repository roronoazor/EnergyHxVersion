# Energy Optimization Application

## Overview

This application is developed as a part of a final year project and focuses on energy optimization. Built with Python and PyQt5, it offers a user-friendly interface for managing and optimizing energy usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure Python is installed on your system. Python 3 is recommended.

#### Installing Python

- **Windows:**
  Download the Python installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Run the installer and ensure you check the 'Add Python to PATH' option.

- **macOS:**
  Python usually comes pre-installed on macOS. To install or update, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) or use Homebrew:

  ```bash
  brew install python
  ```

- **Linux:**
  Python is typically pre-installed on Linux. If not, use your distribution's package manager, e.g.:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3
  ```

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment. This isolates your project dependencies.

   - **Windows:**

     ```cmd
     python -m venv venv
     ```

   - **macOS and Linux:**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - **Windows:**

     ```cmd
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS and Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Requirements:**

   Install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt`.

   ```bash
   pip install -r "requirements.txt"
   ```

### Running the Application

After setting up the environment and installing the dependencies, you can start the application.

- **Windows:**

  ```cmd
  python main.py
  ```

- **macOS and Linux:**
  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```

This command will launch the Energy Optimization application.

## Usage

After launching the application, you can explore its features related to energy optimization. The intuitive interface built with PyQt5 should provide a smooth user experience.
